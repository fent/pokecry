# pokecry

Pokecry is a simple web game in which you can try guessing Who's That Pokemon based on their cry from the games.

Motivation from this came from me and my cousins playing Pokemon games growing up. Whenever we encountered a wild pokemon and heard its cry, the other would often guess which Pokemon it was.
